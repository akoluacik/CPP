# API PROJECT WITH C++

- In this project, my purpose is using different libraries and working with APIs.
- Furthermore, I intend to use design patterns to have readable codes.
- I use dependency injection, which allows my code to resist the modification minimum level.
- I want to add some different APIs to experience beaty of the dependency injection.
- Lastly my intention is adding a GUI using Qt library to this project.
