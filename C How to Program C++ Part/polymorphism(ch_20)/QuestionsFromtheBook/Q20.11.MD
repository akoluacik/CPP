**Q:** (Polymorphic Application) Youâ€™ve been asked to develop a flight simulator that will have elaborate graphical outputs. Explain why polymorphic programming could be especially effective for a problem of this nature.

**A:** Assume there are numerous plane types to be simulated with our program, which have some common and some different properties from each other. This causes to have different member functions. If we implement this program polymorphically, we can create pointers from base class and instantiate objects from concrete classes, and hold address of these object inside a vector. If we traverse the vector by a loop, we do not worry about the type of the pointer because compiler is responsible to it. We can implement a simulation program with less line of code by means of polymorphic program.
