**Q:** Distinguish between virtual functions and pure virtual functions.

**A:** 

| Virtual Functions                                                                                                            | Pure Virtual Functions                                                                                         |

| A virtual function is a member function whose definition is given in the base class which can be redefined by derived class. | A pure virtual function is a member function of base class whose only  declaration is provided in base class.  |
| Classes having virtual functions are not abstract.                                                                           | Base class containing pure virtual function becomes abstract.                                                  |
| Classes which have virtual class can be instantiated.                                                                        | Classes which has pure virtual functions cannot be instantiated, because they have (an) undefined function(s). |
| Not redefining the virtual class does not cause compilation error.                                                           | Though no compilation error, not redefining the pure virtual function makes the derived class abstract.        |
