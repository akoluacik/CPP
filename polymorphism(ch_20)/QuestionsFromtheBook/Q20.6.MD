**Q:** (Virtual Functions) What are virtual functions? Describe a circumstance in which virtual functions would be appropriate.

**A:** 
C++ enables polymorphismâ€”the ability for objects of different classes related by inheritance to respond differently to the same member-function call. This is done by means of **virtual functions** or **dynamic bindings**. Virtual functions are also used to create **abstract classes**. A class **must have at least one** *pure virtual functions* in order to be an abstract class. Body of pure virtual functions must be defined in the class which is child class of the abstract class. We cannot use abstract classes **to instantiate objects**. However, **we can declare pointers and references **to objects of abstract base classes. Such pointers and references can be used to enable polymorphic manipulations of derived-class objects instantiated from concrete derived classes.
