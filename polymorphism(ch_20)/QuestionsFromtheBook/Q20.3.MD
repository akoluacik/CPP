Q: (Programming in the General) How is it that polymorphism enables you to program “in the general” rather than “in the specific”? Discuss the key advantages of programming “in the general.”

A: **Polymorphism** enables you to write programs that process objects of classes that are part of the same class hierarchy as if they were all objects of the hierarchy’s base class. To be specific, we care the program in general and authorize the compiler to deal in specific. We can create pointers from base class and access the member functions of the derived by these pointers(as in the examples of 12, 13,14,16)
