**Q**: Discuss the problems of programming with switch logic.
Explain why polymorphism can be an effective alternative to using switch logic.

**A**: It may hard to check all possible cases with *switch* statement or engineer may forget to check type tests which are most probably true. Furthermore, it may hard to add new statements, or deleting present statements, and **addition or deletion of a class** requires modification of every switch statements, which is quite hard, error prone and time consuming.
